# Device Topology Data Analysis - Issue Resolution

## üîç Issue Analysis

### Problem Identified
The device topology features in the Hardware Timing Analytics Dashboard were not working properly because of a **data file mismatch**.

### Root Cause
The `app.py` file was configured to load `data/sample_timing_data.csv`, which only contains basic timing data with 3 columns:
- Event
- Time  
- Toggled

However, the device topology features require the extended format with 6 columns:
- Event
- Time
- Toggled
- **Device_ID** ‚Üê Required for device topology
- **Position** ‚Üê Required for daisy chain analysis
- **Message_ID** ‚Üê Required for communication analysis

### Data Files Comparison

#### ‚ùå `data/sample_timing_data.csv` (Basic Format)
```csv
Event,Time,Toggled
GPIO_Init,1000,True
GPIO_Init,1500,False
ADC_Read,2000,True
ADC_Read,4000,False
```

#### ‚úÖ `data/sample_data.csv` (Extended Format with Device Topology)
```csv
Event,Time,Toggled,Device_ID,Position,Message_ID
GPIO_Init,1000,True,Device_1,1,
GPIO_Init,1500,False,Device_1,1,
GPIO_Init,1550,True,Device_2,2,
GPIO_Init,2050,False,Device_2,2,
UART_Send,15000,True,Device_1,1,MSG_12345
UART_Send,23000,False,Device_1,1,MSG_12345
UART_Receive,25000,True,Device_2,2,MSG_12345
UART_Receive,25500,False,Device_2,2,MSG_12345
Sync_Pulse,70000,True,Device_1,1,SYNC_1
Sync_Pulse,70300,False,Device_1,1,SYNC_1
Sync_Pulse,70050,True,Device_2,2,SYNC_1
Sync_Pulse,70350,False,Device_2,2,SYNC_1
```

## üîß Solution Applied

### Code Fix
Updated the data file path in `app.py`:

**Before:**
```python
sample_file = 'data/sample_timing_data.csv'
```

**After:**
```python
sample_file = 'data/sample_data.csv'
```

### Verification
1. ‚úÖ Docker image rebuilt successfully
2. ‚úÖ Container running on port 8050
3. ‚úÖ Application loads with device topology data
4. ‚úÖ Dashboard accessible in browser

## üìä Device Topology Features Now Available

### 1. **Device Topology Visualization**
- Shows 5 devices in daisy chain configuration (Device_1 through Device_5)
- Interactive network graph with device positioning
- Drag-and-drop capability for layout editing

### 2. **Synchronicity Analysis**
- Analyzes `Sync_Pulse` events with SYNC_* Message_IDs
- Measures timing differences between devices
- Calculates jitter and synchronization quality

### 3. **Communication Time Analysis**
- Tracks UART message propagation through the chain
- Measures per-hop latency
- Analyzes message routing patterns

### 4. **Device-Specific Analysis**
- Compare execution times across different devices
- Filter analysis by specific device selection
- Performance comparison charts

### 5. **Interactive Topology Editor**
- Multiple topology modes: Daisy Chain, Star, Ring, Mesh, Custom
- Add/remove connections between devices
- Save and export topology configurations

## üéØ Data Requirements

For device topology features to work, CSV files must include:

### Required Columns
- **Device_ID**: Unique identifier for each device (e.g., "Device_1", "Device_2")
- **Position**: Numeric position in the daisy chain (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **Message_ID**: For tracking communication between devices

### Special Event Types
- **Sync_Pulse**: For synchronicity analysis (use Message_ID starting with "SYNC_")
- **UART_Send/UART_Receive**: For communication analysis
- **Standard Events**: GPIO_Init, ADC_Read, Timer_ISR, SPI_Transfer, etc.

## üöÄ Testing Results

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Working Features
1. **Device Topology Stats**: Shows 5 devices in chain configuration
2. **Device Selector**: Dropdown populated with Device_1 through Device_5
3. **Synchronicity Analysis**: Processes SYNC_1 and SYNC_2 events
4. **Communication Analysis**: Tracks MSG_12345, MSG_23456, MSG_34567 propagation
5. **Interactive Charts**: All visualizations render with device-specific data

### üé® Enhanced Visualizations
- Device topology network graph with proper positioning
